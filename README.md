# Django E-commerce Site

This is an e-commerce shop project based on a YouTube tutorial from Dennis Ivy.
Among other things, the app supports logging in, adding items to the shopping cart, sending orders as an authorized or unauthorized user. 
In the next steps, it is planned to expand the functionality - adding a search engine, a user registration page, an item zoom overlay.
